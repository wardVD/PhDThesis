\textit{\\ \noindent If you can keep your head when all about you\\
\indent Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,\\
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\\
\indent But make allowance for their doubting too;\\
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\\
\indent Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,\\
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,\\
\indent And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:\\}
\textit{\\ \noindent If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;\\
\indent If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;\\
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster\\
\indent And treat those two impostors just the same;\\
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken\\
\indent Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\\
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,\\
\indent And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:\\}
\textit{\\ \noindent If you can make one heap of all your winnings\\
\indent And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,\\
And lose, and start again at your beginnings\\
\indent And never breathe a word about your loss;\\
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew\\
\indent To serve your turn long after they are gone,\\
And so hold on when there is nothing in you\\
\indent Except the Will which says to them: `Hold on!'\\}
\textit{\\ \noindent If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,\\
\indent Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,\\
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,\\
\indent If all men count with you, but none too much;\\
If you can fill the unforgiving minute\\
\indent With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,\\
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,\\
\indent And - which is more - you’ll be a Man, my son!\\ \\}
$\sim$ Rudyard Kipling

#Below we give the PV systematic in percentage for a given background. The name of the file corresponds to the 
               #signal that was used to produce these systematics (each signal had a different BDT). How the systematic is calculated:
               #each directory has 50 BDTs. We look at the number of remaining events per bkg per BDT. From this we calculate the average
               #and the minimum and the maximum. Then we select the biggest discrepancy between the minimum and avg and maximum
               #and average and select this discrepancy. From this we calculate the largest relative difference.
#BDT cut here: 0.25
